# Memory Game
Welcome to the Memory Game, a dynamic and engaging web application designed to test your memory skills. As part of my portfolio, this project showcases my abilities as a self-taught web developer in leveraging key React concepts such as state management, component lifecycles, and hooks to build a fully functional application.

## Project Overview
The Memory Game is an interactive, browser-based game that challenges players to select new cards in succession - ignoring prior choices. Designed to improve cognitive skills, it provides an interactive and visually appealing game experience suitable for all age groups.


## Key Features
- **Customizable Difficulty Levels**: Players can choose their level of challenge, influencing the number of cards to match.
- **Score Tracking**: Scores are monitored and displayed, offering players insight into their performance.
- **Efficient State Management**: Demonstrates use of React state hooks to manage game states.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Sound Effects**: Enhances gameplay with audio cues for game events.


## Technology Stack
- **React**: Used for constructing the user interface and managing application state.
- **CSS**: Styles the application for a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the pages.


## Component Descriptions

### App Component
Coordinates the game logic, state management, and renders the appropriate content based on game status, including start screen, game screen, and score.

### Card Component
Responsible for displaying each card and handling click events that drive the game's progress.

### StartScreen Component
Allows the user to set the game difficulty before starting and provides a button to initiate the game play.


## Educational Goals
- **Understanding React Hooks**: Utilizes useState and useEffect to manage and synchronize component states.
- **Component Lifecycle**: Manages the rendering and re-rendering of components based on state changes.
- **Prop Management**: Demonstrates passing props from parent to child components.
